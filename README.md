## Requirements
### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using -the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- You allowed to use a maximum of one global variable
- No more than 5 functions per file
- You are allowed to use the C standard library
- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called monty.h
- Don’t forget to push your header file
- All your header files should be include guarded
- You are expected to do the tasks in the order shown in the project


## Compilation & Output
```$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89 *.c -o monty```
- Any output must be printed on ```stdout```
- Any error message must be printed on ```stderr```

## The monty program

- Usage: ```monty file```
	- where file is the path to the file containing Monty byte code
* If the user does not give any file or more than one argument to your program, print the error message USAGE: monty file, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
* If, for any reason, it’s not possible to open the file, print the error message Error: Can't open file <file>, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
 - where <file> is the name of the file
- If the file contains an invalid instruction, print the error message L<line_number>: unknown instruction <opcode>, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
where is the line number where the instruction appears.
Line numbers always start at 1
- The monty program runs the bytecodes line by line and stop if either:
it executed properly every line of the file
it finds an error in the file
an error occured
If you can’t malloc anymore, print the error message Error: malloc failed, followed by a new line, and exit with status EXIT_FAILURE.
- You have to use malloc and free and are not allowed to use any other function from man malloc (realloc, calloc, …)
